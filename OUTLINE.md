# Game Outline

This is the story/outline/whatever for the game as of 1/27/25 (MM/DD/YY)

## Story

Player wakes up in a sandstone temple with some mechanical stuff in it

Player is then introduced to "basic" mechanics: Exit Teleporters, Player Droppers, Cubes and their Scanners, and Grenades.

Player escapes the temple into the open desert, with some mobility levels.

Player happens upon Facility-Γ, Material Processing, and has to get in by blowing a big hole in the wall with a Big Bomb.

In Facility-Γ, player is introduced to Bouncy Goo, Toxic Goo Pipes, and Doors.

Player escapes by blowing another hole in the wall of Facility-Γ.

Player is in grassy fields for a bit.

Player finds a big bomb, has to light it with a laser to get into Facility-β, Optics Research.

Player is introduced to Reflection Cube, Laser Outlets, and Laser Receivers.

Player escapes by exploding a new hole into the wall (Again)

Player happens upon the Fields of the Viscera, which contain: Gory Ground, Aggressive Growths.

Player fights through a few levels, and finds a large hole in the ground covered in the Large Seal

Player has to find a big bomb, throw it onto the seal, and then light it, in order to explode a hole into Facility-α, Biological Containment

Facility-α is still overtaken by the Viscera, but after a bit, player's only way out is a flickering teleporer, which takes the player to the Final Battle.

Also, chambers in Facility-α orient around trying to find a big bomb to blow up a smaller seal to the teleporter to the next chamber.

The Final Battle is in a large room with a massive, beating heart at the center.

There is a cycle to the battle:
1. Throw 5 grenades into heart
2. Teleporter arrives to take the player to a puzzle
3. puzzle represents the contents of one of the facilities
4. come back to main room, throw a big bomb into the heart
5. repeat

This happens 3 times, one per facility, and then the heart dies. Afterwards, player is teleported back to their bed.

- Grenades: thrown by player after they get them, have a 1s fuse time, propel player
- Exit Teleporters: transport player between levels
- Player Droppers: drop player into levels, allow respawning
- Bouncy Goo: pre-placed on ground. Acts as a bounce pad, basically.
- Door: opens when enabled.
- Toxic Goo Pipe: Only dispenses Toxic Goo when enabled. Basically a door, but inverted.
- Big Bomb: explodes when lit. Blows through Big and Small Seals, cracked walls, and hurts the heart at the end.
