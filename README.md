# ***Frag Out!***

I'm trying to make a puzzle platforming game in JS/HTML with no libraries, cause I loooove fun.

It will feature grenades that bounce around and knockback player.

I have a planned outline in OUTLINE.md soon. maybe.

People aren't really supposed to contribute. like. at all. This is a personal project. Y'all can look at it though.

## stuff about what i've done so far

As of 1/27/25 (MM/DD/YY) I have basic jumping, level saving and loading, tile editing, object grabbing, and other stuff set up.

Also, I am going to work on a system to edit objects. It will use HTML select and option thingies to edit the various things in it.

As of 2/1/25 (MM/DD/YY) I have a roadmap on how I'll develop a demo that has the whole Sandstone Temple section done.

As of 2/10/25 (MM/DD/YY) I have developed all the different laser-related objects. I am very excited. I have also made some tiles for the labs. I have started working on Facility Gamma, which is now Optics Research, so I don't have to make a one-off way of blowing up the bomb.
