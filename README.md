# ***Frag Out!***

I'm trying to make a puzzle platforming game in JS/HTML with no libraries, cause I loooove fun.

It will feature grenades that bounce around and knockback player.

I will have a planned outline or w/e in OUTLINE.md soon. maybe.

People aren't really supposed to contribute. like. at all. This is a personal project. Y'all can look at it though.

## stuff about what i've done so far

As of 1/27/25 (MM/DD/YY) I have basic jumping, level saving and loading, tile editing, object grabbing, and other stuff set up.

Also, I am going to work on a system to edit objects. It will use HTML select and option thingies to edit the various things in it.
